# elm-wind ðŸŒ²

A starter template for building modern frontend applications using [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Elm Land](https://elm.land). 

The project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for fast, disk space efficient package management.

## Features
- Pre-configured Elm Land setup for routing and page management
- Tailwind CSS integration for rapid styling
- Modern package management with pnpm
- Development server with hot reloading

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/elm-wind.git
cd elm-wind
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npx elm-land server
```

Your app will be running at `http://localhost:1234` (or the next available port).

## Local Development
The development server supports hot reloading, so you can start editing files in `src/` and see changes immediately.

## Deploying to Production
Elm Land projects are commonly deployed as static websites. You can deploy your app for free using:

- [Vercel deployment guide](https://elm.land/guide/deploying#deploying-with-vercel)
